#
# A preforking server framework, modeled after how I have read the Apache
# approach described.
#
# There is a master dispatcher and a number of workers. The master does
# a select() on the server socket; when it becomes ready, the master picks
# an idle worker and commands it to do an accept() and handle the request.
# The worker tells the master either that it is now busy (and later that
# it is idle again) or that for some reason the accept() has failed.
#
# If there are no idle workers and we are under the maximum worker
# count, we start a new worker process (and have it handle the
# request). If we are already at the maximum, the master accept()s and
# immediately discards the new connection.
#
# Workers communicate with the master through a socketpair (faked with
# pipes to accomodate pre 2.4 versions of Python), and normally spend
# their time in a read() of the socketpair. The master select()s on the
# listening socket and all of its ends of the socketpairs.
#
# When the master commands a worker to do an accept(), it must wait
# for the worker to respond one way or another. The master shoots
# worker processes that don't respond fast enough.

__doc__ = """
A generic framework for preforking network servers, where a master
process supervises a pool of forked worker processes that handle
the actual connections. Worker processes are started as necessary,
up to a maximum number.

To create a preforking server pool, instantiate an instance of
the ServerPool class with appropriate parameters and call its
.serve() method.
